\section{Background}
CoCIS Sport Gala is a competition among students offering different courses such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information System, and Information Technology at College of Computing and Information Sciences. It is organized by the student leaders to enable Students realize their talent and create unity within the College. The games consist of football, volleyball, basketball, and chess board. The sport gala always takes place in the third week of the semester before test one begins.

\subsection{Team Selection}
After it has been announced that the Sport gala is happening the following week, every class start preparing for it by selecting their team. I sent my name to the class representative convincing him that i can play any type of game. Fortunately, i managed to get positions in two games i.e. football and chess board. I was so excited since football and chess were the only games i know best among all games. Other class members were also selected basing on the previous game's involvement or those who are willing to participate in the game.

\subsection{Team Practice}
Team practices started a week before the tournament day and most participants of my class managed to attend. The team practice always started in the evening after lectures until 7:00pm. Every player was expected to carry along with them, Jersey and boots for those playing football.It was hectic since it involved running around the field ten times and a serious training but i loved it because it improved my skills in football and also made me become physically fit.


\section{Team Competition}
The competition started on Saturday 7th March at 8:00am with Volleyball, Basketball, and Chess Board in the morning, and football in the afternoon. I performed very badly in Chess Board by winning only one game out of three. This made me so discouraged about our class whether we could win in the Sport Gala. I go he courage to play football when i had that our volleyball team won the Software Engineering Stundents.We started football in the afternoon and won two games out of four which made us qualify for the final. The final with Information System Students was hectic but we managed to win 2 to 1 making Computer Science class the Champion of College of Computing and Information Sciences.
\subsection{Awards of winners}
Computer Science class was crowned Champion of College of Computing and information sciences because of winning two games i.e. football and volleyball in the 2017 CoCIS sport gala. We were then awarded trophies by the Student leaders for our wonderful performance. This was one of the best Sport competitions iâ€™ve ever participated in.
\subsection{Celebration}
After the game was over, all players of the winning team were told to go and prepare for a dinner at the staff canteen of Makerere University. I never imagined what it would be like but it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable moments of my life. There were all kinds of food and drinks prepared, and anyone can serve themselves. I was terribly satisfied and even danced to the maximum which makes me never forget of the 2017 Sport gala of College of Computing and Information Sciences.
\subsection{Conclusions}
Having had the most wonderful experiences in the gala, i encourage other Students who have not been participating in the gala to try their talents and they will live to remember how interesting it is.
